        Dumb Luck, by the brilliant, controversial, and influential 
        Vietnamese writer Vu Trong Phung, is a bitter satire of the 
        rage for modernization in Vietnam during the late-colonial era. 
        First published in Hanoi in 1936, it follows the absurd and unexpected 
        rise within colonial society of a street-smart vagabond named 
        Red-haired Xuân. As it charts Xuân's fantastic social ascent, 
        the novel provides a panoramic view of late-colonial urban 
        social order-from the filthy sidewalks of Hanoi's old commercial 
        quarter to the gaudy mansions of the emergent Francophile 
        northern upper classes. A major theme of the work is the 
        transformation of traditional Vietnamese class and gender 
        relations triggered by the growth of colonial capitalism.

        This is a delightful novel (banned in Vietnam until 1986).
         A very satirical piece written by Vũ Trọng Phụng in the 1930's colonial era of Vietnam.
          You don't have to have a great knowledge of Vietnamese history to fully enjoy Dumb Luck, 
          but you probably should not skip Peter Zinoman's introduction contained if that is the case.

        This book is what would happen if the love child of Being There by 
        Jerzy Kosiński and The Possessed by Fyodor Dostoyevsky was kidnapped at birth, raised in
         1930s Hanoi, and, when achieving the emotional maturity of a 13-year-old, forced to write a 
         humorous newspaper serial under deadline pressure.

        This book explores Ho's pre-power political career, from his emergence at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 to his organization of the Viet Minh united front at the start of the Second World War. Using previously untapped sources from Comintern and French intelligence archives, Sophie Quinn-Judge examines Ho's life in the light of two interconnecting themes--the origins and institutional development of the Indochinese Communist Party, and the impact on early Vietnamese communism of political developments in China and the Soviet Union.

        "I never knew a man who had better motives for all the trouble he caused,
        " Graham Greene's narrator Fowler remarks of Alden Pyle, 
        the eponymous "Quiet American" of what is perhaps the most controversial 
        novel of his career. 
        Pyle is the brash young idealist sent out by 
        Washington on a mysterious mission to Saigon, 
        where the French Army struggles against the Vietminh guerrillas. 
        As young Pyle's well-intentioned policies blunder into bloodshed, Fowler, a seasoned and cynical British reporter, finds it impossible to stand safely aside as an observer. But Fowler's motives for intervening are suspect, both to the police and himself, for Pyle has stolen Fowler's beautiful Vietnamese mistress.

        I never knew a man who had better motives 
        for all the trouble he caused . 
        <br>I assume that everyone for once 
        in own life had to face such a moment that,
        though convinced about doing the right thing,
        felt nevertheless poorly and uncomfortably.
        How is it possible , we asked then , 
        we acted righteously so why such bad feeling , 
        such turbulence in our mind ? 
        We did a good choice so why this bile that fills 
        our mouths ? Why that need to rationalize our deed ? 
        There was no other way , we say . But really ? 
        And this is a feeling Graham Greene leaves me with

        As a critique of American intervention in 
        foreign affairs, the story was excellent. 
        The quiet American (he never shuts up) 
        steps into a world he knows nothing about and 
        creates havoc. My problem with the book was a
         problem common to many similar authors (DeLillo, 
         I'm looking at you): it was very male-centric and 
         I got annoyed. Phuong, the love/lust/possession 
         interest in the book, was never given a character, 
         described as innocent, childish, a sexual object, 
         and a caretaker in turn. I realize the character 
         was supposed to be symbolic of the country--both men,
          American and British, wanted to possess her, 
          without understanding her. But it's hard to read a 
          book where women aren't allowed to be women--full 
          fleshed, intelligent and capable of self determination.

        Kien is a survivor of the Viet Nam war, 
        a North Vietnamese survivor. This book is 
        written by a North Vietnamese writer and 
        clearly evokes much of his experience in 
        what was a much longer war for the Vietnamese 
        than it was for Americans. The similarities between 
        the affects of war on all sides are clear, 
        but this tale is uniquely home grown. 
        The story is told in several different time lines. 
        Kien recalls his youth, his early years in 
        the military, a time ten years after he entered 
        the war, events later in the war, the period at 
        its conclusion and a thread in what is the character's 
        contemporary post-war. His central relationship is with 
        his childhood sweetheart Phuong (and one wonders here 
        whether the name is merely a very common Vietnamese given 
        name or if there might be an echo of The Quiet American at 
        play here). As the title indicates, 
        sorrow is a central feature of the story. 
        Kien’s nickname means Sorrowful Spirit.
        And war is certainly a rich cornucopia of grief.

        My main problem with this book, 
        besides the general lack of character 
        development and plot, is that its overall 
        theme seems overdone. 
        <br>The novel follows the story of a 
        North Vietnamese soldier that loses love and 
        faces the hardships of a physical, but also 
        emotional war. Now, it might have been the fact 
        that I had read Things They Carried and Red Badge 
        of Courage only months before, but writing a story 
        about the idea that war causes emotional struggles 
        is not new. It is no longer controversial to 
        depict the front lines as something other 
        than noble and heroic.

        Her commentary and insights into communist Vietnam and Vietnamese family and community dynamics are interesting,

        The winner of the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction,
         as well as five other awards, 
         The Sympathizer is the breakthrough novel of the year. 
         With the pace and suspense of a thriller and prose that has 
         been compared to Graham Greene and Saul Bellow, 
         The Sympathizer is a sweeping epic of love and betrayal. 
         The narrator, a communist double agent, is a “man of two minds,” 
         a half-French, half-Vietnamese army captain who arranges to 
         come to America after the Fall of Saigon, and while building 
         a new life with other Vietnamese refugees in Los Angeles is secretly 
         reporting back to his communist superiors in Vietnam. 
         The Sympathizer is a blistering exploration of identity and America, 
         a gripping espionage novel, and a powerful story of love and friendship.

        Update: exciting news.... This book just won the Pulitzer Prize for this year!!!!!!!!!!!!! VERY EXCITING!!!! VERY Cool!!!!<br>
        The year is 1975 at the start. As communist tanks are about to roll into Saigon,
        a General of the Southern Vietnamese army is saying good-bye to community workers and friends from the Villa they live.
        The General and his and compatriots leave to start a new life in Los Angeles, Calif. <br>
        The Captain 'secretly' reports to a communist-allied -higher up - Viet Cong. about their group. Both secrecy and hierarchy were key to revolution ---which was why there was always another committee higher up!

        I can see how The Sympathizer, 
        Viet Thanh Nguyen's complex novel focusing on the post-Vietnam War experience, 
        won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction this year. It's plenty thought-provoking and weighty, 
        uncompromsing in its candor. It has a snarky sense of humor. It provides a underrepresented 
        (to contemporary fiction, anyway) viewpoint of the Vietnamese diaspora here in the United States. 
        Would it, though, have gotten my vote for the Pulitzer? Nope. I can think of several titles more deserving. 
        Even one of the runners-up for the Prize, Kelly Link's bizarre short story collection Get In Trouble was more deserving, 
        in my opinion.

        Very informative. I started the book before my two week journey to Vietnam,
         and read it during and on the return from the trip. What I read reflected what I saw and experienced 
         in the country, rounding out my experience and filling in a lot of blanks. 
         Examples that stand out are the environtmental destruction of Vietnam's forests, wildlife, eco-systems,
          landscapes (see Chapter 8, \"See it before it's gone\"), and the chapter on US-Vietnamese relations 
          post-American war in Vietnam (Chapter 9, \"Enemies into friends\").
